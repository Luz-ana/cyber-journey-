###  NETWORKING :
#### Network:
			* Connection of devices thorugh channel that might be guided or un-guided. 
			* Every devices on that network is called a node.
			* This channel is used to transmit data over the network.
			* Through this network the devices conected can share resources , share data .

		     * Network is inconnection of devices which is vulnerable to attacks ,hacking.
		     * If some problem occurs on the network all the devices face that problem even causing work to be paused. 	
		     
####  Topology :
	* This means how devices are connected to each other in the network .
		* Physical 
		* Logical
		
			*Physical topology :
				This shows actually how devices are connected to each other in the network .
			* Logical topology :
				This doesnt show how they are connected what intermediate devices are used it just shows the relationship and connection establised . It is from the device point of view .
