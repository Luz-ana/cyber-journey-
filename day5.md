####  virus 
	* program intended to harm others 
#### crypto malware
	*	its the encryption of files and inorder to get the actual data we need to pay.
#### ransomware
	* its the braoder concept , as an attacker under ransomware he/she has access over his/her system .
	* even has power to lock the screen, encrypt,block the system .
	* so main difference about how much it can effect 
	* cryptomalware affects the files only and affects that file by encrypting them whereas ransomware not only goes for the file thing but it can look for the system , files,screen ..

####  rootkit:
	* It is simply envading into someone's system and destroying things or manipulating according to our interest and completely staying hidden so noone knows we are in their system .
	* For example we have task manager that shows everything thats being run into our system 
	* A envaded into the system of B and he installed rootkit(tool) and he changed the kernel instructions and hid his identity from the task manager we might thing that eveyrthing is normal but in real case so many things are happening in B's computer secretly by A.
	* Basically its a tool to hide its activities and do different activies using malware in the system .


####  keylogger :
	*  its recorder to everything we type in our computer and it stores everything we types .
	* then attacker can automate to find patterns or find secret confidential info like password.


####  adware:
	* this shows multiple ads and that might redirect to another page that might have some scripts that might run and download in our computer or run smth on bg using .exe thing 
	* this adware can come from anything we download from shady site or free site and once this gets downloaded into ourt system every site we visit gives the ads pop up and may lead us to smth dangerous .
#### spyware :
	* its simply spying on someone and stealing information and then giving that secret information to the attacker .
	* its for stealing information purpose.
	* we might get confused over rootkit and spyware but the thing is rootkit has access over the system and run malware and hide such activities from the user by changing and os command but spyware is only used to gather information about the victim and provide that information to the attacker .


#### new keyword : non-credential
	* finding something randomly surfacely searching nmap -p-0-65535
	
#### hypervisor :
	* we have a computer setup but we divide that into multiple vms' and that is controlled by hypervisor.
	* it controls all the vms
	* resources for vms are from that system 
#### TYPE 1(bare metal):
	* in this hypervisor we have hardware
	* hypervisor just above that hardwareit acts as a os 
	* then other vms

#### TYPE 2(hypervisor)
		* we have os just abover hardware this is the only difference
